### Description

	Stock Filter 3 is an app which uses a formula to obtain 10 stocks which we believe are wise long term investments. The goal is to have the user make an investment for one year before selling the purchased stock.

	Too many investment sites encourage constant buying and selling of stocks. We wanted to separate the user from the day to day data so they arenâ€™t tempted to sell their investment prematurely. Companies benefit when people buy and sell more because they charge per transaction, our app suggests the opposite.

	The result is a simple app which allows the user to track their investments made with our method. It lets them update their portfolios as changes are made and view our recommended list of 10 stocks to make a yearly investment in.
